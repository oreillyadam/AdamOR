This project was designed to autocomplete a user’s input for the project outlined on moodle as Assignment 1
Unfortunately I still haven’t been able to create JUnit Testers for any of my projects.
An additional feature that I added was the GUI in this project that was not requested.
The assignment is all placed in one class as it all seemed a natural fit to put them in the read class. 
The file reader reads in the supplied words from the exam outline under the title wikiwords .txt.
